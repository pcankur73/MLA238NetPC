Observer Pattern:

Real-life Application: In a stock trading application, where multiple users are interested in real-time updates of stock prices, the observer pattern can be used. Users subscribe to particular stocks and get notified whenever there is a change in the price.

Strategy Pattern:

Real-life Application: In an e-commerce application, where different payment methods (credit card, PayPal, cryptocurrency) are accepted, the strategy pattern can be employed. Each payment method is encapsulated into its own strategy, allowing the system to switch between them seamlessly.

Command Pattern:

Real-life Application: In an application with an undo/redo feature, such as a text editor or graphic design tool, the command pattern can be utilized. Each user action (like typing, deleting, drawing) is encapsulated as a command object, allowing the application to execute, undo, and redo these actions.

Chain of Responsibility Pattern:

Real-life Application: In an organization's expense approval workflow, where expenses of different amounts need different levels of approval, the chain of responsibility pattern can be used. Each level of authority (manager, director, CEO) forms a part of the chain, and an expense request is passed down the chain until it's approved or rejected.

Iterator Pattern:

Real-life Application: In a content management system, where a collection of articles needs to be iterated and displayed, the iterator pattern can be applied. The iterator abstracts the traversal logic, allowing clients to iterate over the collection without exposing its underlying structure.

State Pattern:

Real-life Application: In a traffic light control system, where the behavior of the traffic light changes based on its current state (e.g., red, yellow, green), the state pattern can be employed. Each state (red, yellow, green) encapsulates its own behavior, and the traffic light transitions between states based on predefined conditions.

Interpreter Pattern:

Real-life Application: In a natural language processing application, such as a language translator or a compiler, the interpreter pattern can be utilized. It interprets sentences or expressions in a particular language and performs the corresponding operations.

Memento Pattern:

Real-life Application: In a text editor application, where users can undo/redo changes, the memento pattern can be used to implement the undo/redo functionality. The memento captures the state of the editor at a particular moment, allowing users to revert to previous states.
